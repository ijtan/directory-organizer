# Directory Organizer
A python script which automatically organizes and classifies files & folders from a directory (created for downloads folder, but any valid directory can be specified)

Make sure that the premade directories are applicable and that the file extensions you regulary use are set

## Running the script
```
git clone https://github.com/ijtan/donloads-folder-organizer
cd donloads-folder-organizer
python main.py --dir ** <Path to directory> **
```
## Additional Comments
If no directory is given the script automatically assumes you are trying to sort the test directory
