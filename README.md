# Directory Organizer
-A very simple python script which automatically organizes and classifies files & folders from a directory 
This script was originally created to organize the downloads folder, but any valid directory can be specified

-Only tested on windows

-Make sure that the premade directories are applicable and that the file extensions you regulary use are set

## Running the script
```
git clone https://github.com/ijtan/directory-organizer
cd donloads-folder-organizer
python main.py --dir <Path to directory>
```
## Additional Comments
If no directory is given the script automatically assumes you are trying to sort the test directory
